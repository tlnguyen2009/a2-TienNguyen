## Squeesh The CockRoach
You just need to follow instruction/button on screen to play this game. You click on the cockroach image to earn points - each mouse click is one (1) point. At the end of each game, player can save their name and the players can view their ranking by clicking on "Ranking" button at the top-left corner and click "Game" button to go back to game.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created single-page app with multiple screens. Using <div> sections (.first-section, .game-section, etc.) to show each screen and using ***Flexbox*** for **layout and position: fixed** for the sticky navigation bar, ensuring a consistent user experience across different game screens. I also have a form for users to submit data (the "Save Score" form). The app shows the current data saved in server-side when the user navigates to the **Ranking** screen. 

- **Tech Achievement 2**: Let player **delete** the data in **Ranking** screen. I will update function to let player edit their name later.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
Peer Review for my Game App
1/ Benedict Antwi (bantwi@wpi.edu):
- With my previous design, the user couldn't expect what will happen in my game and how to play it. 

- He recommended me to leave a small instruction at the first page so the users can know what they should do when they hit "play" button. And surprisingly, it was the same thing I was thinking about too but not sure if it's needed, however, thanks to my friend feedback, I know we need that.

- I created a small instruction at the main page.

2/ Rohit Tallapragada
- He thinks my background color could look better if the background color was different from plain black, maybe a super dark green.

- Making all the text font the same as the font at the main page will make them look cool.

- Get an Adobe color scheme pack and use it for buttons, background,...
