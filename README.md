## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created single-page app with multiple screens. Using <div> sections (.first-section, .game-section, etc.) to show each screen and using ***Flexbox*** for **layout and position: fixed** for the sticky navigation bar, ensuring a consistent user experience across different game screens. I also have a form for users to submit data (the "Save Score" form). The app shows the current data saved in server-side when the user navigates to the **Ranking** screen. 

- **Tech Achievement 2**: Let player **delete** the data in **Ranking** screen. I will update function to let player edit their name later.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
Set of question to ask peers to check app's UI:

You'll need to use sometype of collaborative software that will enable you both to see the test subject's screen and listen to their voice as they describe their thoughts, or conduct the studies in person. After completing each study, briefly (one to two sentences for each question) address the following in your README:

1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
2. What problems did the user have with your design?
3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
