## Squeesh The CockRoach
You just need to follow instruction/button on screen to play this game. You click on the cockroach image to earn points - each mouse click is one (1) point. At the end of each game, player can save their name and the players can view their ranking by clicking on "Ranking" button at the top-left corner and click "Game" button to go back to game.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created single-page app with multiple screens. Using <div> sections (.first-section, .game-section, etc.) to show each screen and using ***Flexbox*** for **layout and position: fixed** for the sticky navigation bar, ensuring a consistent user experience across different game screens. I also have a form for users to submit data (the "Save Score" form). The app shows the current data saved in server-side when the user navigates to the **Ranking** screen. 

- **Tech Achievement 2**: Let player **delete** the data in **Ranking** screen. I will update function to let player edit their name later.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
Peer Review for my Game App
1/ Benedict Antwi (bantwi@wpi.edu):
- With my previous design, the user couldn't expect what will happen in my game and how to play it. 

- He recommended me to leave a small instruction at the first page so the users can know what they should do when they hit "play" button. And surprisingly, it was the same thing I was thinking about too but not sure if it's needed, however, thanks to my friend feedback, I know we need that.

- I created a small instruction at the main page.

You'll need to use sometype of collaborative software that will enable you both to see the test subject's screen and listen to their voice as they describe their thoughts, or conduct the studies in person. After completing each study, briefly (one to two sentences for each question) address the following in your README:

1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
2. What problems did the user have with your design?
3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
